# ImgClassRPi
Image classification for Raspberry Pi using tensorflow. Doesnt rely on Model Maker or other high-level APIs. This is intended since for python 3.10 and onwards, there are a lot of dependency conflicts ATM. However, it uses tflite_support for metadata writing, which seems unaffected by DC.
